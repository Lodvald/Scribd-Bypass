# Scribd-Bypass
A little python tool that allows the user to download the pages of a book from Scribd's webpage and converts them into a pdf bypassing the requirements of either subscribing to the service (even with a 30 days free trial) or to upload files to gain access to the whole library.

# How it works
The program asks the user where to save the images of the pages to stitch, it can be either a pre-existing folder or a new folder that the program creates in the present working directory.
If the user choses the folder it need to be spcecified with the full path (i.e. /home/"user_name"/"folder" on Unix systemx and C:\Users\"user_name"\Desktop\"folder"), in case the folder doesn't exist the program will notify the user and prompt again to indicate a folder.
